# Spotibook

## Setup

Run `npm install` in the root directory of the project

## Local Run

Run `npm run build:watch` in one terminal, and `npm run dev` in another terminal. The first watches the frontend code and rebuilds when you make a change, the 2nd is running the node server

Once these are running, you can access the entire app at `localhost:4443`, and making changes to the frontend or backend should hot reload.
